					100ml or 3.4 fl. oz. $10.20.  <br/>
					It has a raspberry scent. It’s a light cleanser that foams up. It’s ok. I wouldn’t buy again.
					It has a terrible formulation because the cleanser separates from each other so I have to shake to mix it back together
					every time I use it which was not good.  One part water and other part the little cleansing beads.

					Buy again? Maybe <br/>
					4.05 fl oz for $9.60 <br/>
					I like this cleanser. It smells like matcha and in a good way. I just dont know how it isn’t a pump so kinda inconvenient to open and squeeze if my hands are wet.  It’s a very thick cleanser so its hard to squeeze. It foams but not a lot which I like. I would buy again.  It makes my face clean and gentle.

					<h3>Glossier’s Milk Jelly Cleanser </h3>
					<p>
					02/2020 - 08/2020 
					<br/>
					Buy again? 8/10 no	<br/>
					$18	<br/>
					GEL consistency. It does not foam up. It smells like roses. 
					I first used the sample and thought it was very plain but it was very gentle which was something different that I’ve never used before.  
					I like that it is like a jelly. I also like that I can put it on dry skin and it will melt/breakdown the makeup.  Feels gentle on my skin.
					Glossier’s Milk Jelly Cleanser. I like this cleanser bc it’s a gel and it doesn’t foam up. Super gentle on my skin which I like. Only thing I don’t like is that it kinda smells like roses but I got used to it. The bottle lasted about 6 months for $18 for 6 oz. I like the applicator that it comes with bc it’s the perfect amount to wash my face with.  It takes off makeup very gently which I love. 2/20-8/8/20. Would definitely recommend for a gentle cleanse but also cleans makeup and oil.
