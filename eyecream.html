					<h2>Eye Cream</h2>
					<p>A page for eye cream. my thoughts on eye cream is that it is not necessary if you have a good moisturizer. 
                        However, it is a nice luxury.  Be gentle around the eyes because the skin around the eyes is the most thin and sensitive
                        part of your body. 
                         </p>

						08/19/2021- 10/15/2021 2nd  <br/>
					Buy again? Yes	<br/>
					0.5 oz for $9.99 <br/>
					Started 1/30/21. I started using in the PM because i use their Bright-i in the morning. started 2nd 08/19/21-10/25/21. It’s a gel light consistency. Doesnt have fragrance but idk if it does anything bc I can’t tell if it makes my dark circles go away.

					<h3> The Inkey List Brighten-i Eye Cream </h3>
					<p>
						11/17/2020 - 08/19/2021 <br/>
					Buy again? Yes	<br/>
					0.5 oz for $9.99 <br/>
					It has an applicator end which is great especially when I put it in the fridge and it gets cold.  Its a gel consistency which I like. I like how Inkey List tries to educate their consumers about their products bc they have great description on what’s in the product and when the use the product.  It’s meant to be used within 6 months but I only used it in the AM which made it last for a long time

                        Maybe since it’s been sitting in my collection for 2 months but I noticed that it shrunk. It is a VERY THICK consistency so it was difficult to apply. First impression: fine lines look like they have flattened out which is very surprising.                
                        I think it really works bc the fine lines under and around my eyes went away.

                        It is a gel consistency. Does not brighten.  I like that it is light weight and glides easily onto my under eyes.

                        It’s just hydrating. Not brightening. Medium weight like it’s not super light or heavy.

                       Very smooth and brightens bc it has a orange yellow tint. I think it makes my fine lines smoother.

                        $16 in Korea but $24 at Sephora.  It is a large jar so worth buying at that price.  Hydrating but doesn’t seem like it does anything like it does not brighten and i still have fine lines. Good for a starter eye cream. Light weight. used 08/2020 to 5/2020.

                        $41<br/>
                        only use for the AM which i did not like because I wanted an eye cream that could be used both day and night.

                        $30	<br/>
                        It’s green which makes it brighten the skin under my eyes. However don’t know if it’s making a difference w fine lines. Very thick and brightens.
